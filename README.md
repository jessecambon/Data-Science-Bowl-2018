## Table of Contents

### For Local Use

- [meshnet_v17.ipynb](meshnet_v17.ipynb) - an implementation of a [MeshNet approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00940.pdf). This approach was chosen to reduce computational requirements.
- A variety of other notebooks are in [Archive](Archive)

### For Use on Google Collab
